# parkapp

This is the test app for Parkbob SDK integration. It contains following features:
- showing splash screen for 2 seconds with a meaningful name on the first startup
- Parkbob SDK integration
- If the user taps on the Map, drop a pin, load RulesContext and display them on the map. (Points + Lines) 
- Added user interface control to change between “now” and “next”
- Assigned each RuleType a dedicated color. When the user changes between now and next, the colors change accordingly.
- Added button that redirects the user to a Maps application for navigation to the currently selected location
